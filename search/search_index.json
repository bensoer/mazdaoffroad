These A/Ts look really good on it and are probably the easiest and simplest way to add more capability to the car. </p> <p>These aren't the largest, from my research, that you can get without any rub, but its the largest you can get with an LT (light truck) rating and fit within the max wheel well depth.</p> <p>Also the hub caps were a great Amazon find. I look at vehicles primarily for their utility, so they are just steel wheels under there, but the steels do look offensively bad I found, so these hub caps give it a nice cleanup with the black-on-black.</p>"},{"location":"builds/maurice-2021-cx-30-gt/#q-what-is-or-was-the-intention-behind-the-build","title":"Q: What Is or Was The Intention Behind The Build ?","text":"<p>This is meant to be as much of an \"offroader\" build as I can. I primarily do a lot of hiking, backpacking, road trips and camping, but I also want to try and dip my toes as much into offroading as I can with her. Most of my driving still is on the highway or on pavement, but its always that last hour or so to get to the campsite or hiking trail that you need that bit more that a regular car just won't cut it for. So this is that \"little bit more\", without braking the bank on an 80k+ vehicle or on gas.</p>"},{"location":"builds/maurice-2021-cx-30-gt/#q-what-is-advice-tips-you-would-give-for-anyone-else-wanting-to-modify-their-cx-30","title":"Q: What Is Advice / Tips You Would Give For Anyone Else Wanting To Modify Their CX-30 ?","text":"<p>Learn about your tires and the limitations of them for the CX-30. There are a lot of tools on the internet for measurements and information on tires. Most dealerships and car shops won't know what your talking about half the time or will just do what you ask without checking if it will cause issues. CX-30s are not common offroaders, so many shop staff who would know about offroad modifications, from my experience, have never tried on a CX-30. The CX-30's biggest tire issue is that the wheel wells are narrow and this means you will run into issues with the tire width before you reach the max diameter of the wheel well.</p> <p>Also note when increasing or changing your tire size, will mean your speedometer will start lying to you. My setup only has about a +5-10km/hr difference, and it really only shows at highway speeds. So you never have to worry about speeding through a school zone, but youll want to be aware on the highway your probably going 5-10km more then whatever the spedometer says. But there are more combos of rim and tire size and that can have different effects on your speedometer.</p>"},{"location":"builds/maurice-2021-cx-30-gt/#socials-contact","title":"Socials &amp; Contact","text":"<p>  @outthere_andback</p>"}]}
